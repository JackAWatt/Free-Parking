Joe's issues:

Prod manager - Monica Munoz opinions:
- untimely moves -> probs @ production line
- trailers arriving late/eod not unloaded, sit overnight - unsecured Munos says Perez not taking command of it (conflict between them)
- dispatchers/dock foremen don't like each other

- Munoz and Perez agree theft is issue, but disagree on cause

Perez aware of:
- number of complaints from dock foremen about late trailers
- number of complaints from dock foremen about dispatchers not answering phones
- number of complaints from dispatchers about dock foremen not giving sufficient lead time to get to docks
- dispatchers/dock foremen, aware of them not liking one another
- trailers arriving to plant/warehouse not unloaded, sit overnight dock foremen trying to get ahead, ordering them too late, or to start unloading first thing in the morning
- foremen not paying enough attn to trailer reqs
- may be 6000/mo on trailer fees, not sure this IS the case, but could be lower
- 12 drivers on lease, not sure if correct, could be improved
- half 7-1600, half 8-1700, breaks and lunch not formalized times - everyone on break or lunch at the same time is possible

- conflict with munos - has some responsibility, but both sides need to be part
- conflict with driver, question if they're doing job properly
	- not pro union
- conflict with eduardo, are phones always manned?


Christ Patstone:
- ome used to own TT, and drivers were employees
- dock had assigned drivers, managed by the docks
- going back to previous would increase efficiency
- dispatchers won't like it
- distributed networks these days, but ome is currently centralized
- phone is busy, dispatchers not at phones
- sitting overnight - theft, fault of dispatchers not getting them there in time to be unloaded


Eduardo:
- dock foremen don't provide sufficient time
- tt drivers are herding cats, can't manage
- drivers return trailers to incorrect spots, and don't inform anyone
- the more trailers in incorrect spots, the more errs there are, and the more out of place trailers get - cascades
- once a week err checking on 300 spots, system never completely accurate
- bill of lading into comp is manual and slow
- jose always says to decrease fees, need to see what are overdue, not a good way to do so
- dispatchers/foremen don't like one another
- dispatcher in office at all times - not the case often, both dispatchers outside handling trucks (or take smoke breaks together, or on personal business, etc.)
- can actually be hard to reach, but will deny this, become angry if accused by analyst


charles norris:
- trailers not in correct spots, have to search and find it
- no issues, just drive the trucks

- will ask for proof if it's even hinted they're doing job wrong
- computer in truck, not liking it
- be crotchety
- worried about being laid off


150-250/300 spots in yard

500 calls per day
300 radio per day

200 trailers moved per day

6000 avg detention fees


- figure out all issues... then figure out which are priority



wishlist (follow up on this):
monica:
- TTCS so efficient, no complaints from dock foremen
- MMS tells you what materials are on site
- having to check w/ jose to be sure that MMS matches TTCS
- inquiry on TTCS that relates to components, not trailers
- change in procedure, never leave trailers at dock overnight
- comprehensive system to track broken seals, exec-level reporting
- exec-lvl reporting for req'd vs actual trailer deliv. - daily/weekly/monthly

traffic admin:
- driver productivity sys - screen inquiry/hard copy reprts
- finish products not left @ dock overnight
	- late trailers never the cause of unloaded trailers being left
- exec-lvl tracking trailer fee situation
- broken seal tracking
- req'd vs actual trailer delivery times


dock foremen:
- decrease or elim. need to telephone dispatchers
- ensure req'd trailers never late
- exec-lvl req'd vs actual trailer deliv. times by dock foreman


dispatcher:
- phone issues
- dock foremen enter requests of what, when, where, and have that order processed.
- locate components (if more than one trailer, longest trailer there)
- list of tasks for drivers - screen in truck?
- don't get rid of radios, still need as backup
- visual map of yard, status of parking locations & docks w/ trailer info
- daily report listing oldest to newest trailers, grouped by shipping company. flexible as possible
- visual representation of all drivers & status
- bill of lading sent electronically & preloaded into system
- get rid of/improve after hours arrivals - courtesy, but a problem
- drivers never wait at docks - they shouldin't be, but make it so
- tracking broken seals/trailers to repair


charles norris:
- nothing, no change
- wary of computer consultants
- don't want to be running a computer
