D2:

viscosity - 

miscible-

pure substances
-kind of matter that has definite compisition and constant properties
-are uniform and the same throughout
-all samples have the same components inthe same ratio

ex

soiam chroride-(table salt)
	NaCl

sucrose-table sugar
	c(12)h(22)o(11)

copper - Cu

elements contain 1 kind fo atom

atom is smallest particle of a substance

elements join with other elements to make compounds

any element can be represented by a chemical symbol

CO vs Co   
        CO = carbon monoxide
        Co = cobalt

diatomic elements -

seven non metallic elements which exist as pairs of atoms held together by chemical bonds

H O F Br I N Cl

when in combination with other elements5 in compounds these 7 diatomics lose their tendency to be paired together.

ex H2O

ammonia = NH(3)

compounds - 
        composed of two or more elements
        can be separeted by chemical reactions only
        have predictable properties
        compounds have specific atom ratios that don't change


C(2)H(5)OH - ethonol
C(2)H(6)
