silver [Kr]5s(2) 4d(9)

tellurium [Kr]5s(2)4d(10)5p(4)

all s orbitals to region

right hand: no 1 p sub lvl

lewis structure;
    electrons can fit on each of the four sides.


pairs are happy


every atom wants to be like a nobel gas.

    atoms hav a tendency to form certain types of ions or molecules is the
    octet rule
    octet rule - atoms react by changing the numbers of electrons to acquire
    the stable electron config of the neaet gas

    to form a compound an atom can gain or lose one or more electrons
    when the number of protons does not equal number of electrons the atom
    becomes an ion
    ions : atoms or groups of atoms that have a positive or negitive charge
    formed from the loss or gain of electrons


chlorine atom:
    atom -> 17p+/14e-

    1s(2) 2s(2) 2p(6) 3s(2) 3p(5)

anion = negatively charged ions

chloride ion

ending changed to ide

potassium 19p+/19e-

1s(2) 2s(2) 2p(6) 3s(2) 3p(6) 4s(1) 

1e-
8e-
2e-
19p+
k

k*

atom = 1 valence



no ending change for positive ions

positive ions = cations

x(x)

flourine atom gain 1e-

isoelectronic - when atoms gain or lose electrons to acquire the same electron
structure as the nearest noble gas

groups 1,2,13
    metals
    lose electrons
    positively charged ions = cations

groups 13,16,17
    non metals
    gain electrons
    negitively charged ion = anions
