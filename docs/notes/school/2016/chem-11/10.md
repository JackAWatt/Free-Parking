types of compounds

Ionic
    binary
        
        - only 2 elements
        - cation + anion
        = metal + non metal
            +       -
        - end in ide
        - can have multi valent metals
            more than one charge
            ex: Fe2+ - iron 2 or ferrous ion
            Fe 3+ iron(iii) or ferric ion
        example:
            NaCl sodium chloride
            SnBr2 tin (II) bromide
            
    ternary ionic compounds
        - contains more than 2
        - must contain a polyatomic ion
        - contain cation and anion
        - can and often contain metals but not always
        - endings often are "ate" or "ite"
        - example
            Na2SO4 sodium sultate
            Ca3(PO4)2 calcium phosphate
        - 
    hydrates
