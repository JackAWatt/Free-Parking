unit 5:

    endothermic - page 3 -> H2O(s) -> H2O(l)

    exothermic - page 3 -> H2L(g) -> H2O(l)

    C3H8(g) - propane - medium amount of energy

    same elements / new partners

Nuclear:

    235/92 U + 1/0 N  -> 141/56 Ba + 92/36 Kr + very large amount of energy

    intermolecular forces broken and made (page 4)

    
collisions
    frequency
        influenced by speed of velocity of particles


2 H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O)g) + energy

spark explosive

 page 8/9

 sucrase enzyme bonds to scurose

C3H8(g) + O2(g) -> CO2(g) + H2O(g)
    carbon hydrogen oxygen

ways to desc formation of rust
    iron reacts with oxygen to produce iron (III) oxide

    Fe(s) + O2(g) -> Fe3+ O2-

formation or sythesis or combination reaction -
    R + S -> RS

word equation:

    sodium reacts with chlorine to produce sodium chloride

    sodium + chlorine = sodium chloride

    Na(s) + Cl2(g) -> NaCl(s)


chen equation:
    Mg(s) + O2(g) -> MgO(s)

    solid magnesium reacts with gaseous oxygem to yield solid magnesium oxide


decomposition

    water decompses into hydrogemand oxygen.

NiCO3(s) -> NiO(s) + CO2(g)

solid nickel (II) carbonate decomposes with heat solid nickel (II) oxide and
carbon dioxide


combustion:

C x H y  + O2 -> CO2 + H2O

methane burns in oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water

CH4(g) + O2(g) -> CO2(g) + H2O(g)
