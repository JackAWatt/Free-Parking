atom > nucleuos

negitive charge outside the nucleous

proton
    subatomic (in the atom) that has a positive charge located in the necleus
    p+
neutron
    subatomic particle with zero charge and it's found in the necleus
electron
    negatively charged subatomic particle, found outside the necleus with
    almost no mass
nucleus
    very small dense portion of the atom that contains protons and neutrons


atomic + 55 ==> 55 p+ 55 e-

cesium-133 - isotope
       ^^^
mass number

(55)Cs

neutrons = mass number - protons
    133 - 55 = 78 neutrons

    

write the atomic number, mass number, protons, electrons, neutrons

(53/24)Cr
    24,53,24,24,29
(55/24)Cr
    24,55,24,24,31
(7/3)Li
    3,7,3,3,4
(6/3)Li
    3,6,3,3,3

given the following info

30 p+, 30 e-, 35(n)0
30, 65, Zn
29 p+, 29 e-, 36(n)0
29, 65, Zn

Zinc-65 && Copper-65 are isobars - elements that share a mass number
