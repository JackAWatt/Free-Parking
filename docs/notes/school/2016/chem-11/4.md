physical property:
	heavy/mass
	

melting point-
	unknown blue crystaline salt on hot plate, melt pont is 900 c, melts then resolidifies, stil same substance

boilng point

electrical conductivity
	wont conduct electricity is a physical property

-magnetism
	
-state (s/l/g)

-lustre (shiny)	
	chrome

viscosity (thick, restistance to flow)

volatility (how quickly it evaporates)
	gasoline: evaporats quickly



ex: 
	table salt:
		white
		solid
		non dictile
		soluble in water	
		2.17 g/cm(3) [1g/cm3 water]
		* atomic mass []
		not a strong odor
		NaCl[s] -> NaCl(l) @ 801 c
		

chemical properties
	of a substance describes its chemical reactions with other substances 
	they are only observed when a substance is undergoing a change in composition
	

chemical properties: examples

	does it burn in air?
	does it decompose when heated
	does it react with another substance
		[like an acid or oxygen, or a metal]
	will it tarnish
	

chemical or physical property(cp/pp)
	colour: pp
	flammability: cp
	solubility: pp
	density: pp
	magnetism: pp
	reactivity: cp
	rust: cp

instensive properites
	independant(chemical and physically) of sample size
	most properties are intensive.
	ex	
		colour
		melting point
		flammability
	
extensive properites
	one that relates to the amount of material present in a sample
	ex:	
		mass: specific to how much you have
		volume: have to messure it
		length


sulfer:
	brittle solid room temp: physical property
	reacting with carbon: chemical property
	will not disolve in water: physical propertyy

*meat and bones*

physical change
	will alter a substance without changing its compisition or identity
	most often the change is reversable

*end of meat and bones*

water from liquiod to gas
	H(2)O(l) -> H(2)0(g)

	N(2) - diatomic
	N2(l) -> N(2)(g)

key words for change

cut : 
bend : 
melt : 
boil : 
split
condense
break
crush


suger disolved in water

C12H22O11(s) -> C12H22O11(aq)

aq = disolved in water = aqueous

chemical change occurs when one or more substances are changed into new substances wtih new properties

key words for chamical change

rust Fe(s) + O2(g) -> Fe(2)O(3)

decay
	dead mouse
		3000 flies


growth
decompose
digestion
corrode
rott
ferment
burn

bbq - C(3)H(8)(l) (in tank) -> (l) when released

indicators of chemical change
	new odour or smell
	colour change
	heat or light ( realease of energy)
	bubbles typically indicate a new gas in produced
	production of a solid from mixing two solutions together - precipitate
	

pp , cp, pc, cc

alcohol is flamable - cp
alcohol is volile - pp
salt in water - pc
battery lost charge over 6 months - cc
