pure substance is the same everywhere

compound and elements are the only pure substances.

diatomic elements:

	
properties of common substance:
	NaCl(s) - table salt
	
	solid
	

NaCl(s) -> Na(6) + Cl(2)(g) - electrictiy to get sodium (electrolisis)

substances that are created have very different properties than their previous form

chlorine gas yellow/green toxic - used to fight

nitrogen is 4th most in human body 3%

mixtures - 
	a physical blend of two or more substances.
	[E + E] [E + C] [C + C]

	all mixtures can be separated by some physical means like distilation or density
	
	alchool 78 c boiling point - page 12

	no single chemical foumula or chemical symbol for a mixture

	composition may vary

	may or may not be able to see different components.


homogeneous mixture
	mixtures with completely uniform compisition
	also called solutions
		solution - has a solute disolved in solvent.

	salt water - salt is solute, water is solvent

	water - universal solvent

	all solutions don't need water, water is most common

	alloy - homogeneous mixture of two or more metals

	
hetrogeneous mixture
	type of mixture not uniform in compisition
	there may be more than one layer
	ex: party mix, oil with water, soil


are these: homo mix, hetro mix, pure

windex - homo
relish - hetero
salmon - hetero
granola bar - hetero
gasoline - homo
octane - C(8)H(18) pure
mr clean - homo
salsa - hetero
contact lense cleaner - homo

element
element

mixture

physical properties
	is a quality of a substance which you can observe without changing the substances compisition
	color
	solubility
	odor
	mass
	hardness(gold:soft, copper:hard)
	density(mass/volume)
	malleability
	ductile (pull into wires)
