* Go through the [Exploitation on Arm-based
  Systems](https://github.com/sashs/arm_exploitation) slides by Sascha Schirra
* Read about writing ARM shellcode ([Execve Shell](https://azeria-labs.com/writing-arm-shellcode/), [Bind Shell](https://azeria-labs.com/tcp-bind-shell-in-assembly-arm-32-bit/), [Reverse Shell](https://azeria-labs.com/tcp-reverse-shell-in-assembly-arm-32-bit/)) if you want to use your own shellcode
* Have the [ARM reference
  manual](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0068b/index.html) handy in case you need to look something up
