## 30 hours to the skill of investing 30 hours to learn a skill
* 15 * 2 hour sessions
* once per week
* it makes sense to not plan all the sessions before starting. The layout on
  ARM exploitation was written by the person who wrote most of the content for
  the sessions. In the future it would make sense to use buffer time between
  sessions to plan the subsequent session. 

## session 1: plan out a few sessions towards skills to learn
* ARM exploitation - planning done by azeria. Using as a guide for other skill
  session plans
* math - figure out areas of weakness and plan out sessions around them
* syntopical reading - plan out sessions around reading books/papers with the
  intent of being able to write about the content in my own words

* ### notes
Created directories for the three 30-hour sessions

layed out first few sessions in each doman
